# Pay-PY
I wrote this script to make it easier to calculate how much I can expect to earn each week given how many hours I worked. Federal taxes are estimated using a quadratic 
regression generated by [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) as the line of best fit for my week-to-week Federal tax withholdings. All other taxes are estimated 
using the rates prescribed by relevant State and Local governments.
